# MLOps Assignment 3 — AutoML Model Evaluation

## Assignment Instructions

Use your chosen MLOps platform for the following tasks:

1. Load the (same) athletes dataset.
2. With your dataset, use AutoML to find the best model.  
   - If it is no-code, submit screenshots.
3. Report any data insights from the AutoML run.
4. What are the reported top 5 features?
5. What are the top 3 models per validation score when using:
   - All features  
   - Only the top features (if you have to choose a number, put in 3)
6. What are the top 3 models per speed when using:
   - All features  
   - Only the top features (if you have to choose a number, put in 3)
7. How do the top models compare to your previously developed models (Assignments 1 and 2) in terms of validation score and speed?
8. Is your platform AutoML no-code / low-code / full-code and why?
9. Repeat steps 2–5 using H2O AutoML  
   ([H2O Docs](https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html)). Submit code.


## Tools Used

- **FLAML (Fast and Lightweight AutoML)** — Python-based, full-code AutoML
- **H2O AutoML** — Low-code AutoML platform with leaderboard and interpretability


## Acknowledgments

- I used **ChatGPT** to assist with:
  - Debugging Python errors
  - Formatting and interpreting AutoML outputs

All final decisions and implementations were made by me based on class concepts and assignment goals.
